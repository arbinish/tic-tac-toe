# tic-tac-toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game implementation in javascript.

# Play modes
There are two modes available:
1. Manual, in which two players take turn. First player is given then name player-1, and the other player is player-2. There is no provision given to name the users.
2. Automatic, mainly for debugging purpose. I wrote this for my kids to understand various winning strategies. Click the "AI" button and enjoy the game.

# How to Play
Open index.html in any browser. Tested in Chrome and Firefox only. Should work in other browsers too.
